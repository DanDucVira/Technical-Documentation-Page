                <p>JavaScript was first created in 1995 by Brendan Eich over 10 days while at Netscape. Unusually
                    JavaScript
                    has no concept of input/output; it is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment,
                    typically the web browser but also elsewhere such as on the server with NodeJS.<br>

                    Its syntax is similar to Java and C languages. While JavaScript supports object-oriented programming
                    it
                    is prototype-based and functions are first class, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other
                    functions.<br>

                    JavaScript is often called an interpreted language but it is best thought of conceptually as
                    compiled.
                    The JavaScript engine reads through the entire code first checking for errors and variable/function
                    declarations. Then it will go through and execute the code, top-to-bottom, line by line, recursively
                    descending into code blocks as needed. This JIT (just-in-time compilation) approach yields many
                    performance wins and is also adopted by Python and Ruby interpreters.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variables_and_Data">
                <header>Variables and Data</header>
                <p>Think, if you will, of a variable as a shelf with a name so it’s easy to get back to. You’ve named a
                    shelf surname.</p>

                <p>You can name a variable anything you like, but it’s best to name it in a way that tells what you’ve
                    stored there. For example, surname is better than mything or s.</p>

                <p>When you type a variable name into the console you are asking the browser, which looks after the
                    shelves, to go find the shelf and give what’s on it to you. This is also known as the variable’s
                    value. The value can be almost anything - in surname, you’ve stored some letters, known as a string.
                    You can also store numbers and a myriad other kinds of data.</p>

                <p>So, a variable has a name and a value.</p>

                <p> They are the way we store data, and you’ll be using them a lot.</p>

                <p> There are two parts to creating a variable; declaration and initialization. Once it’s created, you
                    can assign (or set) its value.</p>
                <h4>Declaration</h4>
                <p>Declaration is declaring a variable to exist. To return to the shelf metaphor, it’s like picking an
                    empty shelf in a massive warehouse and putting a name on it.</p>
                <p>As above, to declare a variable, use the var keyword followed by the variable name, like this:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> surname;</code><br>
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> age;</code>

                </div>
                <h4>Initialization</h4>
                <p><strong>Initialization</strong> is giving a variable its <strong>value</strong> for the first time.
                    The value can
                    change later, but it
                    is only initialized once.
                </p>
                <p>You initialize a variable using the equals sign (=). You can read it as “the value of the variable on
                    the left should be the data on the right”:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> name = "Tom";</code>
                </div>
                <p>“Tom” is a <strong>string</strong> - a collection of letters. A string is surrounded by single or
                    double quote marks.

                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> age = 20;</code>
                </div>
                <p>20 is just a number - and numbers don’t go in quotes.</p>
                <h4>Assignment</h4>
                <p>As mentioned, you can set a variable’s value as many times as you like. It’s called assignment and it
                    looks very similar to initialization. You again use the equals sign, but there’s no need for the var
                    keyword because we’ve already declared the variable.</p>
                <p>It's like this:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>name = "Andy";</code><br>
                    <code>age = 43;</code>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Only </strong>do this if you’ve declared the variable using the var keyword!</p>

            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Math">
                <header>Math</header>
                <p>Variables can be used to store strings and numbers (amongst other things), but here the focus is on
                    numbers.</p>
                <h4>How much fruit?</h4>
                <p>let’s create two variables. One will be the number of apples we have, the second will be the number
                    of pears.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> apples = 5;</code><br>
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> pears = 10;</code>
                </div>
                <p>That creates two variables… but there’s only one <span class="var-color">var</span> keyword? Yup,
                    it’s
                    a shorthand for declaring and
                    initializing multiple variables at the same time. By using the <span class="var-color">var</span>
                    keyword once and separating the
                    new variables with commas you can save yourself some work.</p>
                <p>Now, use these two variables to figure out how many pieces of fruit there are in total.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> piecesOfFruit = apples + pears;</code>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Logic">
                <header>Logic</header>
                <p>A really important part of programming is being able to compare values in order to make decisions in
                    code. When a comparison is made the outcome is either true or false; a special kind a of data called
                    a <strong>boolean</strong>. This is <strong>Logic</strong>.</p>
                <p>Like when doing math, there’s a set of operators that work on booleans. They are used to compare two
                    values, on the left and right of the operator, to produce a boolean value.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>The following comparisons are made in<br> the console. The result we get from<br> each line<br>
                        (shown
                        underneath) will be <span class="var-color">true</span> or <span
                            class="var-color">false</span>;<br>
                        these are booleans.</p>

                </div>
                <h4>Equality</h4>
                <p>To find out when two values are equal, use the triple equals operator (“===”).</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>15.234 === 15.234</p>
                    <p>true</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Conditional">
                <header>Conditional</header>
                <p>Logic is used to make decisions in code; choosing to run one piece of code or another depending on
                    the comparisons made. This requires use of something called a conditional.
                    There are a few different conditionals that you might want to use, but we’ll just focus the one used
                    most commonly: if.</p>
                <h3>iF</h3>
                <p>It’s very simple: if some logic (the condition) is true, run a block of code. You can also supply
                    more code to be run if the condition is not true, and supply additional conditions and blocks of
                    code to optionally be run. These forms are called if-else, as you’ll see below.</p>
                <p>The most simple if statement looks something like this:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>if (10 > 5) {<br>
                        // Run the code in here<br>
                        }</p>
                </div>
                <p>The code between the braces - “{” and “}” - is called a block, and this one is linked to the if
                    statement. It’s only run if the conditional (between the parentheses) is true. 10 is indeed greater
                    than 5, so the code in the block would run.</p>
                <h3>if-else</h3>
                <p>The if-else form of an if statement is used to run an alternative piece of code if the conditional is
                    not true. The code in the if block below will be ignored, for example - only the code in the else
                    block will be run.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>if (43 < 2) { <br>// Run the code in here }<br> else <br> {<br> // Run a different bit of code
                            <br> }
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Looping">

                <header>Looping</header>
                <p>Loops are a way of repeating the same block of code over and over. They’re incredibly useful, and are
                    used, for example, to carry out an action on every item in an array (we will come to arrays later)
                    or in searching.</p>
                <p>Two of the most common loops are while loops and for loops. They combine a conditional and a block,
                    running the block over and over until the logic of the conditional is no longer true, or until you
                    force them to stop.</p>
                <h3>While</h3>
                <p>A while loop repeats a block of code while a condition is true. Like an if statement, the condition
                    is found in parentheses.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>
                        var i = 1;<br>
                        while (i < 10) {<br> alert(i);<br> i=i + 1;<br>} // i is now 10 </p>
                </div>
                <p>After looping has finished the code carries on running from just after the closing brace (“}”) of the
                    loop’s block.</p>
                <h3>For</h3>
                <p>A for loop is similar to an if statement, but it combines three semicolon-separated pieces
                    information between the parentheses: initialization, condition and a final expression.</p>
                <p>The initialization part is for creating a variable to let you track how far through the loop you are
                    - like i in the while example; the condition is where the looping logic goes - the same as the
                    condition in the while example; and the final expression is run at the end of every loop.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>
                        for (var i = 1; i < 10; i++) { <br>
                            </10>alert(i);<br> } </p>
                </div>
                <p>This gives us alert boxes containing the numbers 1 to 10 in order.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
                <header>Functions</header>
                <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that carry out a specific task. To execute the code in a
                    function you call it. A function can be passed arguments to use, and a function may return a value

                    to whatever called it.</p>
                <p>You can save functions as the value of a variable, and you call a function using this variable and a
                    pair of parentheses. This is also called invoking the function.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>
                        doSomething();<br>
                        findAnInterestingThing();</p>
                </div>
                <p>To create a function, use the function keyword. You then list the arguments in parentheses, and then
                    supply a block that contains the function’s code. Here’s a function that adds two numbers:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>
                        var add = function (a, b) {<br>
                        return a + b; <br>
                        };</p>
                </div>

                <p>a and b are the function’s parameters, and the value it returns is signified by the return keyword.
                    The return keyword also stops execution of the code in the function; nothing after it will be run.
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>
                        var result = add(1, 2); // result is now 3
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Objects">
                <header>Objects</header>
                <p>JavaScript objects are like a real life objects; they have properties and abilities. A JavaScript
                    object is, in that sense, a collection of named properties and methods - a function. An object can
                    be stored in a variable, and the properties and methods accessed using the dot syntax.</p>
                <p>A human, for example, has a name and an age, and could talk, move or learn JavaScript. Name and age
                    are properties of the human, and are essentially pieces of data. Talking, moving and learning are
                    more like functions - there’s some complex behavior involved. When a JavaScript object has such an
                    ability, it is called a method.</p>
                <p>Variables can hold objects, and creating an object is done using a special syntax signified by
                    braces:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>
