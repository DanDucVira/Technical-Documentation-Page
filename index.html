            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>JavaScript was first created in 1995 by Brendan Eich over 10 days while at Netscape. Unusually JavaScript
                has no concept of input/output; it is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment,
                typically the web browser but also elsewhere such as on the server with NodeJS.<br>

                Its syntax is similar to Java and C languages. While JavaScript supports object-oriented programming it
                is prototype-based and functions are first class, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other
                functions.<br>

                JavaScript is often called an interpreted language but it is best thought of conceptually as compiled.
                The JavaScript engine reads through the entire code first checking for errors and variable/function
                declarations. Then it will go through and execute the code, top-to-bottom, line by line, recursively
                descending into code blocks as needed. This JIT (just-in-time compilation) approach yields many
                performance wins and is also adopted by Python and Ruby interpreters.</p>
