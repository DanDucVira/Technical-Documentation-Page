                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>JavaScript was first created in 1995 by Brendan Eich over 10 days while at Netscape. Unusually
                    JavaScript
                    has no concept of input/output; it is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment,
                    typically the web browser but also elsewhere such as on the server with NodeJS.<br>

                    Its syntax is similar to Java and C languages. While JavaScript supports object-oriented programming
                    it
                    is prototype-based and functions are first class, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other
                    functions.<br>

                    JavaScript is often called an interpreted language but it is best thought of conceptually as
                    compiled.
                    The JavaScript engine reads through the entire code first checking for errors and variable/function
                    declarations. Then it will go through and execute the code, top-to-bottom, line by line, recursively
                    descending into code blocks as needed. This JIT (just-in-time compilation) approach yields many
                    performance wins and is also adopted by Python and Ruby interpreters.</p>

                <h3>Variables and Data</h3>
                <p>Think, if you will, of a variable as a shelf with a name so it’s easy to get back to. You’ve named a
                    shelf surname.</p>

                <p>You can name a variable anything you like, but it’s best to name it in a way that tells what you’ve
                    stored there. For example, surname is better than mything or s.</p>

                <p>When you type a variable name into the console you are asking the browser, which looks after the
                    shelves, to go find the shelf and give what’s on it to you. This is also known as the variable’s
                    value. The value can be almost anything - in surname, you’ve stored some letters, known as a string.
                    You can also store numbers and a myriad other kinds of data.</p>

                <p>So, a variable has a name and a value.</p>

                <p> They are the way we store data, and you’ll be using them a lot.</p>

                <p> There are two parts to creating a variable; declaration and initialization. Once it’s created, you
                    can assign (or set) its value.</p>
                <h4>Declaration</h4>
                <p>Declaration is declaring a variable to exist. To return to the shelf metaphor, it’s like picking an
                    empty shelf in a massive warehouse and putting a name on it.</p>
                <p>As above, to declare a variable, use the var keyword followed by the variable name, like this:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> surname;</code><br>
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> age;</code>

                </div>
                <h4>Initialization</h4>
                <p><strong>Initialization</strong> is giving a variable its <strong>value</strong> for the first time.
                    The value can
                    change later, but it
                    is only initialized once.
                </p>
                <p>You initialize a variable using the equals sign (=). You can read it as “the value of the variable on
                    the left should be the data on the right”:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> name = "Tom";</code>
                </div>
                <p>“Tom” is a <strong>string</strong> - a collection of letters. A string is surrounded by single or
                    double quote marks.

                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> age = 20;</code>
                </div>
                <p>20 is just a number - and numbers don’t go in quotes.</p>
                <h4>Assignment</h4>
                <p>As mentioned, you can set a variable’s value as many times as you like. It’s called assignment and it
                    looks very similar to initialization. You again use the equals sign, but there’s no need for the var
                    keyword because we’ve already declared the variable.</p>
                <p>It's like this:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>name = "Andy";</code><br>
                    <code>age = 43;</code>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Only </strong>do this if you’ve declared the variable using the var keyword!</p>

            </section>
            <section class="main-section">
                <h3>Math</h3>
                <p>Variables can be used to store strings and numbers (amongst other things), but here the focus is on
                    numbers.</p>
                <h4>How much fruit?</h4>
                <p>let’s create two variables. One will be the number of apples we have, the second will be the number
                    of pears.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> apples = 5;</code><br>
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> pears = 10;</code>
                </div>
                <p>That creates two variables… but there’s only one <span class="var-color">var</span> keyword? Yup,
                    it’s
                    a shorthand for declaring and
                    initializing multiple variables at the same time. By using the <span class="var-color">var</span>
                    keyword once and separating the
                    new variables with commas you can save yourself some work.</p>
                <p>Now, use these two variables to figure out how many pieces of fruit there are in total.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code><span class="var-color">var</span> piecesOfFruit = apples + pears;</code>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section">
                <h3>Logic</h3>
                <p>A really important part of programming is being able to compare values in order to make decisions in
                    code. When a comparison is made the outcome is either true or false; a special kind a of data called
                    a <strong>boolean</strong>. This is <strong>Logic</strong>.</p>
                <p>Like when doing math, there’s a set of operators that work on booleans. They are used to compare two
                    values, on the left and right of the operator, to produce a boolean value.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <p>The following comparisons are made in the console. The result we get from each line (shown
                        underneath) will be <span class="var-color">true</span> or <span class="var-color">false</span>;
                        these are booleans.</p>
                    <h4>Equality</h4>
                    <p>To find out when two values are equal, use the triple equals operator (“===”).</p>
                    <div class="code-block">
                        <p>15.234 === 15.234</p>
                        <p>true</p>
                    </div>
